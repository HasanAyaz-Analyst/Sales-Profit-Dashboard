# Sales-Profit-Dashboard
In this project, I created an interactive, multi-page dashboard to deliver a detailed analysis of sales and profit data. The dashboard offers the following features:

Dashboard Overview: Introduced an overview page summarizing the dataset name, project objectives, and a clear explanation of each dashboard page. This introductory page helps users understand the purpose and insights provided by the dashboard.

Sales and Profit Overview: Developed a high-level summary page focusing on key metrics such as total sales, profit, and other highlights. This section gives quick access to critical performance indicators.

Trend Analysis: Designed a trend analysis page to examine demographic data, uncover hidden issues, and track key trends over time. This analysis helps in understanding customer behavior and identifying patterns impacting sales.

Product Performance: Created a product performance page to highlight individual product metrics, including sales volumes, profit margins, and top-performing products. This page allows for an in-depth look at each product's contribution to overall revenue.

Sales by Segment and Region: Built a final page to analyze sales by customer segment and geographical region. It provides key insights into regional and segment-specific performance, allowing for targeted marketing and sales strategies.
